To-do: 
	raspberry pi auto run bash script on start up
	find way to use raspberry pi
	find how to use driver station to change autonomous
	velly crow crow
	come up with multiple autonomous programs
	autonomous code for lifting and dropping box
	finding random start position
	make linear movement account use gyroscope for straighter movement
